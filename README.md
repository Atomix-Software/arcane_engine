# Arcane Engine

A simple Game Engine meant to be an alternative to what's out there.


## How to Build

First Clone the project:
```
git -clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/Atomix-Software/arcane_engine
```

Then navigate to "scripts" and press the [os]-premake script file relative for you.
So far only Windows is supported via Visual Studio 2022
