# Arcane Engine

This is a complete rework of my prior "Arcane Engine"
At the time I was following a tutorial instead of doing things myself therefore there was a lot I lost in terms of learning.
This time around it's going to be all me and perhaps *some* external resources.

The overall intent of the engine is going to be for my own personal development, but perhaps at *some point* I will allow others to use and even contribute to the engine itself. Just depends on how long I intend to keep at it and how far I can get on my own skillset.

The engine itself is written entirely in C++ with plans for lua scripting in the future. This is likely to change and I might take note from something like Unity or Unreal and use C#. Lua is simple and there's tons of resources online for learning it so I feel its the safer bet.

The editor's UI will likely be done with [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
There will be a [trello](https://trello.com/) board for this at some point where I will have it visible to all until I allow contributions.
